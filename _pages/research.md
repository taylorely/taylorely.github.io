 excerpt: "Marine Molecular Ecology I am especially interested in using environmental DNA (eDNA) methods for large-scale community genetic studies. My research currently focuses on connectivity across the North Central Pacific using multiple techniques such as eDNA and oceanographic larval dispersal models."
