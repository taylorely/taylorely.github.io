     excerpt: 'My research focuses on using eDNA methods for large-scale community genetic studies. I recieved my B.S. in Marine Biology and minor in Environmental Systems and Societies from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2018. In undergrad, I worked as a lab assistant in the Barber Lab and completed my senior honor's thesis focusing on the persistence of environmental DNA in a marine ecosystem.'
