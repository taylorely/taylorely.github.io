     excerpt: 'My research focuses on using eDNA methods for large-scale community genetic studies. I recieved my B.S. in Marine Biology and minor in Environmental Systems and Societies from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2018. After undergrad I interned as an Oregon Sea Grant Scholar with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife Marine Reserves. There I studied the recovery from sea star wasting disease in the intertidal.'
