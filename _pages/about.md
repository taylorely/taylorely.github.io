     excerpt: 'My research focuses on using eDNA methods for large-scale community genetic studies.

     I recieved my B.S. in Marine Biology and minor in Environmental Systems and Societies from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2018. In undergrad, I worked as a lab assistant in the Barber Lab where I discovered my love for marine genetics. I then completed my senior honors thesis in the Barber lab focusing on the persistence of environmental DNA (eDNA) in a marine ecosystem. I also interned at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History extracting samples from ARMS from the coral triangle in the Meyer Lab. After undergrad I interned as an Oregon Sea Grant Scholar with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife Marine Reserves. There I studied the recovery from sea star wasting disease in the intertidal. Then I worked as a lab technician in the Carlon Lab at Bowdion College in charge of parrotfish gut content analysis using eDNA techniques. Currently, I am a PhD candidate in the zoology program at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in the Marko Lab. I study connectivity across the North Central Pacific using multiple techniques such as eDNA and oceanographic larval dispersal models.'
